**✈️ Flight Price Analysis — Data Analytics Project**

🎯→ This project explores and analyzes an airline flights dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to ticket pricing, flight duration, departure times, and other key factors.
The full analysis is performed using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib in a Jupyter Notebook.

**📌 Project Overview**

→ Flight prices vary due to multiple factors like airline, duration, route, days left for the journey, and departure time.
This analysis aims to understand:

🔺 How ticket price changes with different variables

🔺 How days left before travel affect pricing

🔺 The impact of flight duration

🔺 Differences between airlines

🔺 Identification of outliers and inconsistencies in the dataset

🔺 The insights can help understand flight pricing behavior and potentially guide customers or businesses in decision-making.
